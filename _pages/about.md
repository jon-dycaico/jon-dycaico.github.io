There is much in the world today that is cause for concern. AI is poised to replace much of the economy, the financial system is [unustainable](https://substack.com/@balajis/p-147004047), geopolitical tensions are rising, and freedom for future generations seems further and further out of reach.

What if [Applied Cryptography](https://crypto.stanford.edu/) offered ways out? What if Blockchains, ZK-proofs, Security and Privacy tech could fundamentally fix our economic system, the privacy nightmare, and even the Defender's Dillemma in cybersecurity? What if we could build our way out, atop the firm foundation of cryptography?


I believe Crypto (shorthand for Applied Cryptography), is the most promising field in computing. AI, left unchecked, will unleash a flood of endless novelty, exacerbating society's worst trends. But Crypto offers the opportunity to build highly-robust systems that can ensure human flourishing into the future.
