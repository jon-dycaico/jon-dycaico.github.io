*Gauntlet AI*

I was enrolled in a AI Engineering bootcamp that focused mostly on building Rapid MVPs of Frontend applications in React. As I have never been interested in frontend development, I kept myself going by working on this side project in my free time.OCTOPUS is a multi-component system with a local AI model at its core, and a set of system services as its appendages. It was initially concieved to fool and disrupt malware and otherwise protect the host system, but the vision evolved over time to a holistic AI-Engineering Platform, wherein OCTOPUS learned from user interaction with the OS and supported the user's activities, actively and dynamically. I was also experimenting with a new approach to storing and indexing Markdown files on a user's machine, such that manual file management would no longer be an issue.

Essentially, OCTOPUS is a first attempt at a new vision for computing wherein the "hard lines" of a traditional OS are symbiotically inhabited by a "fuzzy logic" System-LLM such that the system is well-protected, well-maintained, and continually building itself into a better tool for the user.
